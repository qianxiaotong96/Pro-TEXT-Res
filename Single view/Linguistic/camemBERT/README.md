# Description

This repository includes the clustering (conventional and HistStream) results of dataset **_camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx_**

## First step -- select final dataset to apply clustering

- **_camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying ```diff - camamBERT+LSTM``` as burst embedding model trained by predicting the pause duration (**pause**);
- **_camemBERT_pause_BiLSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying <font color="blue">camamBERT+BiLSTM</font> as burst embedding model trained by predicting the pause duration (**pause**);
- **_camemBERT_pctpause_LSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying <font color="blue">camamBERT+LSTM</font> as burst embedding model trained by predicting the percentage of the pause duration (**pctause**);
- **_camemBERT_pctpause_BiLSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying <font color="blue">camamBERT+BiLSTM</font> as burst embedding model trained by predicting the percentage of the pause duration (**pctpause**);
