# Description

This repository includes the clustering (conventional and HistStream) results of dataset _camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx_

## First step -- select final dataset to apply clustering
```
- _camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+LSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the pause duration (**pause**);
- _camemBERT_pause_BiLSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+BiLSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the pause duration (**pause**);
- _camemBERT_pctpause_LSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+LSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the percentage of the pause duration (**pctause**);
- _camemBERT_pctpause_BiLSTM.xlsx_ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+BiLSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the percentage of the pause duration (**pctpause**);
