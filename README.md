# Clustering results of project Pro-TEXT (including word/burst embedding results)

## Introduction

The ANR ProTEXT project (NÂ° ANR-18-CE23-0024-01) is an interdisciplinary research project that investigates the dynamic processes involved in text production from a linguistic and cognitive perspective. This research is based on the analysis of writing patterns that emerge from keyboard interactions, with a particular focus on text segments produced between pauses, also known as "bursts of writing". The overall aim of the project is to gain insight into the relationship between regularities in linguistic performance and the contextual constraints that influence the writing process.

More details about the project can be found at: https://pro-text.huma-num.fr/.

This repository focuses on the application of clustering techniques to one of the ProTEXT datasets, **_planification_seuils_persos_07_12_21_NaN.xlsx_** (we smoothly remove several samples that contains NaN/invalid values from the original file **_planification_seuils_persos_07_12_21.xlsx_**, with an emphasis on the pre-processing (word/burst embedding) and clustering of both single-view and multi-view data.

More details about the process of embedding and clustering analysis could be found in this thesis (Chapter 5) : https://theses.fr/2024CYUN1320.
