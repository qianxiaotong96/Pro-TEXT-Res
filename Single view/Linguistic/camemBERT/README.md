# Description

This repository includes the clustering (conventional and HistStream) results of dataset __camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx__

## First step -- select dataset from __camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx__, __camemBERT_pause_BiLSTM.xlsx__, __camemBERT_pctpause_LSTM.xlsx__, __camemBERT_pctpause_BiLSTM.xlsx__
"""
- __camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+LSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the pause duration (**pause**);
- __camemBERT_pause_BiLSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+BiLSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the pause duration (**pause**);
- __camemBERT_pctpause_LSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+LSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the percentage of the pause duration (**pctause**);
- __camemBERT_pctpause_BiLSTM.xlsx__ : dataset obtained by applying **camamBERT+BiLSTM** as burst embedding model trained by predicting the percentage of the pause duration (**pctpause**);
