# Description

This repository includes the clustering (conventional and HistStream) results of dataset **_camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx_**

## First step -- select final dataset to apply clustering

- **_camemBERT_pause_LSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying $${\color{#326a95}camamBERT+LSTM}$$ as burst embedding model, trained to predict pause duration (**pause**);
- **_camemBERT_pause_BiLSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying $${\color{#326a95}camamBERT+BiLSTM}$$ as burst embedding model, trained to predict pause duration (**pause**);
- **_camemBERT_pctpause_LSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying $${\color{#326a95}camamBERT+LSTM}$$ as burst embedding model, trained to predict percentage of the pause duration (**pctause**);
- **_camemBERT_pctpause_BiLSTM.xlsx_** : dataset obtained by applying $${\color{#326a95}camamBERT+BiLSTM}$$ as burst embedding model, trained to predict percentage of the pause duration (**pctpause**);
